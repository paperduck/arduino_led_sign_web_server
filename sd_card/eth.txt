	> mac address in this format: 90-A2-DA-0F-96-BE
	> EXACTLY TWO hex digits in each part.
	> Dashes REQUIRED between parts.
	> Capital letters ONLY. NO lowercase letters.
line 2:
	> Blank line will trigger auto-IP assignment
	> OR put an ip address in this format: 10.10.151.129
	> If writing an IP address, one to three digits per part is okay.
line 3:
	> This can have anything, but it needs to exist. Whitespace is okay.
